## Github
- What is Github: Github is a big online storage or library where people keep their work but instead of book, it is full of code and files
- How it works
1. Version control: GitHub uses a system called Git. Git tracks changes you make to files, so you can go back to any version if needed. It’s like a “save history” for your projects.
2. Repositories (Repos): A repository is like a folder for a project. You can have one for each project you work on. Inside, you store your code, images, documents, and anything else related to the project.

3. Collaboration: GitHub is popular because it allows many people to work on the same project. For example, if you and your friends are building a website together, everyone can contribute their parts and combine them easily using GitHub.

4. Open Source Projects: Lots of people share their code publicly on GitHub. This means you can see, use, or contribute to projects made by others, helping you learn and grow.

5. Pull Requests and Issues: If someone wants to suggest changes to a project, they can make a “pull request.” You can also track problems or tasks using “issues.”

   In summary, GitHub is a platform where people store, share, and work on code together, making it easier to manage projects and collaborate with others.
